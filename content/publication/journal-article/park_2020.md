publication_short: "The Silurus microdorsalis is known as Korean endemic slender catfish. Despite its value as a biological resource, there is no complete mitochondrial genome sequence. The complete mitochondrial genome consisted of 16,524 bp including 22 transfer RNA (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNAs), 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), and A + T rich region. The overall base composition of S. microdorsalis was A + T: 56.1%, C + G: 43.9%, apparently with slight AT bias. Phylogenetic relationship showed that S. microdorsalis was closely related to Silurus glanis."
