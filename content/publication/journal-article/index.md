abstract: Pseudarthrobater sp. NIBRBAC000502771 is a Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped and auxin producing bacterium which was isolated from shooting range soil in Hongcheon, Republic of Korea. We report the complete genome sequence of the strain. A whole genome contig was composed of 4,495,979 bp length with 66.1% of G + C contents and 4,295 genes. The complete genome contains genes to produce auxin and genes resist to heavy metals.
