abstract: "Ex situ conservation is used to protect endangered wildlife. As captive and wild long-tailed gorals are known to be similar, individuals under ex situ conservation can be reintroduced into nature. However, there is no appropriate indicator to evaluate them. Here, we amplified the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and compared the gut ecological information (eco-information) of captive and wild long-tailed gorals. We validated the existing ITS86F and ITS4 universal primers using reference sequences of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and improved their matching rates. We compared the gut eco-information of captive and wild long-tailed gorals obtained through experiments using the improved primer pair and found that the gut ecological diversity of captive gorals was low. Based on this, we suggested that the gut eco-information can be used as an evaluation index before reintroducing captive long-tailed gorals. Furthermore, we identified four plant types from the gut eco-information of wild long-tailed gorals, which can be the additional food sources to enhance the reduced intestinal ecological diversity of the captive animals."
