abstract: "Pseudarthrobacter sp. NIBRBAC000502772 is a Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped, auxin-producing bacterium that was isolated from the soil of a shooting range in Hongcheon, in the Republic of Korea. The whole genome of the strain is 4,803,563 bp in length, with 65.01% G + C content and 4,450 genes. The strain contains genes related to auxin biosynthesis and heavy metal resistance. In addition, it has been found to contain genes related to denitrification of nitrite and nitrate."
