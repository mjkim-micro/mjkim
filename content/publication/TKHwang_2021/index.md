abstract: "Bacillus aryabhattai GW320 (= KACC 22234) was isolated from the rhizosphere of Cucumis sativus L. in Gunwi-gun, Republic of Korea, and its whole-genome sequence was analyzed in this study. Its whole genome consists of circular chromosomes and plasmids, with genome sizes of 6,036,752 bp and 152,341 bp, respectively. The G + C content of its chromosome is 61.5%. The chromosome and plasmid contain 5,599 protein- coding genes. Besides, genes related to auxin biosynthesis, urea degradation, and nitrogen assimilation were identified in the chromosome. Thus, Bacillus aryabhattai GW320 has the potential to be an agriculturally useful strain."
