abstract: "KUDC8001T was isolated from the rhizosperic soil of Elymus tsukushiensis in the Dokdo Islands, Republic of Korea. Strain KUDC8001T was Gram-stain-negative, non-motile and rod-shaped. KUDC8001T was catalase- and oxidase-positive. This strain is capable of growing at 4–37 °C and pH 7.0–8.0 and exhibited optimal growth at 25 °C and pH 7.0. It could be grown in R2A, nutrient agar and ISP2 agar plates. The cell width ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 µm, and length ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 µm. The genomic G+C content was 40.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, revealed that the strain KUDC8001T belongs to the genus Adhaeribacter , which is most closely related to the strain A. pallidiroseus HMF7616T (97.5%). The DNA relatedness of KUDC8001T with the type strains of A. pallidiroseus HMF7616T, A. swui 17 mud1-7T and A. arboris HMF7605T was ≤80.3 % based on average nucleotide identity calculations and ≤86.9 % based on average amino acid identity calculations. In silico DNA–DNA hybridization values of the strain KUDC8001T with the most closely related strains were 22.1, 24.0 and 24.4 %. Based on its phenotypic, phylogenetic, genetic and chemotaxonomic features, the strain KUDC8001T should be considered as a novel species in the genus Adhaeribacter , for which we have proposed the name Adhaeribacter radiodurans sp. nov. The type strain is KUDC8001T (=KCTC 82078T=CGMCC 1.18475T)"
