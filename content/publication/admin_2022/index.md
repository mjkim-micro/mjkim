abstract: "Bacillus inaquosorum 1HC-NA is isolated from the soybean rhizosphere soil in Republic of Korea. The complete genome sequence of B. inaquosorum 1HC-NA was obtained through Oxford Nanopore sequencing. The total genome length of this strain is 4,240,317 bp with 44.0% of GC content. This strain contains 3,293 protein-coding genes, 30 rRNA genes, 86 tRNA genes and 5 ncRNA genes. Furthermore, Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) predicted a total of 332 subsystems of the strain, including amino acids and derivatives and carbohydrates subsystem."
